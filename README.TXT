Module: PDF

This is alpha software. It shouldn't crash, and I hope it will grow.

Description:

The PDF module allows the editing of existing PDF files and the creation of
new ones. At the moment, not everything is supported very easily, so
contributions are welcome.

Included in the distribution are two utilities:

pdfbklt.bat     Turns single paged documents into booklets
pdfrevert.bat   Strips off one layer of changes from a PDF document
